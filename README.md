# SPOT A BOT

## Abstract 

Since the 2016 US elections, the possibility of interference of twitter automates accounts (bots) meddling facts with fake news, spreading the content through an intensely social activity has gained the spotlight.  As the Canadian Federal election approached we collected a large number of messages from official Canadians candidates twitter account and from random accounts that used specifics hashtags. A sentiment analysis algorithm was applied to the tweet content and the user description text. Others feature as the number of followers and days since user signup were taken into consideration. Data analysis techniques used to analyze and summarize the behavior of well-known bots and not bots accounts and the result shows differences between both accounts types. The differences draw in a dashboard provide pieces of evidence that a supervised algorithm can help classify potential bots users and identify their social interaction behavior.
